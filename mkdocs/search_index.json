The library then runs them on the GPU or CPU, this makes TensorFlow great for simulating differential equations. GPUs can perform many computation much faster than CPUs, using this library one can harness this performance for simulating differential equations. The simulation can run on the GPU or the CPU without any change in code.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThis package is still in an early stage of development, therefore it is not yet\navailable from PyPI. To install it, just clone this repository and run:\n\n\npython3 setup.py install\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\nThis package allows you to symbolically define differential equation and\nsimulate them using TensorFlow, this allows one to use the GPU for the actual simulation without ever using C\nor CUDA. All important classes and functions are in the \ndiff_eq\n namespace, therefore\nthis is best way to import tensorflow-diff-eq:\n\n\nimport\n \ntensorflow_diff_eq.diff_eq\n \nas\n \ndiff_eq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in defining a differential equation is to create a \nDifferentialEquation\n\nobject:\n\n\neq\n \n=\n \ndiff_eq\n.\nDifferentialEquation\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you must specify how many quantities will be involved in your differential equation.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n(\nx\n,\n \nk\n,\n \nm\n)\n \n=\n \neq\n.\ngenerate_quantities\n(\n3\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have the references for these quantities you can define them using the\n\ndefine_quantity\n function.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\neq\n.\ndefine_quantity\n(\nk\n,\n \n3.0\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n1\n)(\n0.0\n)\n\n\neq\n.\ndefine_quantity\n(\nm\n,\n \n0.7\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n1\n)(\n0.0\n)\n\n\neq\n.\ndefine_quantity\n(\nx\n,\n \n1.0\n,\n \n1\n,\n \n2\n)(\n-\nk\n.\nd\n(\n0\n)\n*\nx\n.\nd\n(\n0\n)\n/\nm\n.\nd\n(\n0\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to this function is the quantity which is being defined, the second parameter is an initial value and the third parameter is the grade of the derivative, that shall be\ninitialized with it. All other derivatives are initialized to zero of the respective datatype.\nThe forth argument is the grade of the \"definition\" derivative, this definition has the form\n\n\\frac{d^nx}{dt^n} = \\phi,\n\nwhere \nn\n is the grade supplied as the forth argument and \n\\phi\n is any expression\ninvolving previously defined quantities or \nx\n, which is the quantity that is currently being defined. Arbitrary \nn^{th}\n-grade derivatives of the quantities are accessed using \n.d(n)\n, the quantity itself has to be accessed using \n.d(0)\n.\n\n\nOnce you have supplied the system with the differential equation in this fashion, you can start the simulation. In order to do this, you must generate a tensorflow operation that runs\nthe simulation. Such an operation can be generated using \neq.generate_simulate_operation\n and can then be run using a tensorflow session. The function has one argument which is the \n\\Delta t\n that will be used for the simulation.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nPlease make sure you run the \ntf.initialize_all_variables()\n operation after defining the quantities involved in your differential equation.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n# Start tensorflow\n\n\nsess\n \n=\n \ntf\n.\nSession\n()\n\n\nsess\n.\nrun\n(\ntf\n.\ninitialize_all_variables\n())\n\n\nsimulate_op\n \n=\n \neq\n.\ngenerate_simulate_operation\n(\n0.005\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point you can just do \nsess.run(simulate_op)\n to simulate, if you want to access\nany quantity at any time you can run \nsess.run(x.d(0))\n, where \nx\n is the quantity that you want to know the value of.\n\n\nIf you wish want to know more about how this package works, have a look at the example it the \nexamples folder\n.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIt is quite handy to define a \nt\n quantity and set it's first derivative to one in order to keep track of the \"time\".
