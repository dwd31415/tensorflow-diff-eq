# Differential Equations for TensorFlow
A python package for simulating differential equations using TensorFlow.
![Lorenz Attractor](https://github.com/dwd31415/tensorflow-diff-eq/blob/master/examples/lorenz_attractor_animated.gif?raw=true)
# Installation
This package is still in an early stage of development, therefore it is not yet 
available from PyPI. To install it, just clone this repository and run:

```
python3 setup.py install
```
    
# Examples
Two simple examples, the classic harmonic oscillator and the Lorenz Attractor are available in the examples folder.
 
# Documentation
The documentation for this package is hosted [here](https://dwd31415.github.io/tensorflow-diff-eq/).
If you want to learn more about differential equations themself, I would recommend this [MIT OCW Course.](https://youtu.be/ZvL88xqYSak?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oTpyxCMLKt_JmB0WtSZfG)
